# Early proposal writeups

This directory contains writeups of early proposals to move the `Foldable1` and
`Bifoldable1` classes to `base`. These proposals were later superseded by [this
Core Libraries
Committee](https://github.com/haskell/core-libraries-committee/issues/9)
proposal, which was eventually accepted. As a result, the proposal writeups in
this directory are mostly of historical interest.

Note that these proposals refer to a `foldable1` package, which later became
the current `foldable1-classes-compat` package.
